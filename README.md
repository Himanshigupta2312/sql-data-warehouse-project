Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! üöÄ
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.

**üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture**
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:    
  1.Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.                        
        2.Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.             
  3.Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

**üìñ Project Overview**
This project involves:

Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

**üöÄ Project Requirements**
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**
Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

**BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)**
**Objective**
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

Customer Behavior
Product Performance
Sales Trends
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
