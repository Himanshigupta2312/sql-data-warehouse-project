📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution—from raw data ingestion to business insights. It serves as a portfolio-ready example, applying best practices in data engineering and analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture
This project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern, consisting of three layers:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw data ingested from CSV files as-is into a SQL Server database.

Silver Layer: Cleans, standardizes, and transforms the raw data for analysis.

Gold Layer: Final, analytics-ready data modeled using a star schema for reporting and dashboarding.

📖 Project Overview
This project includes:

Modern Data Architecture: Structured with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

ETL Pipelines: Extract, transform, and load data into the warehouse.

Data Modeling: Creation of dimension and fact tables optimized for analysis.

Reporting & Insights: SQL-based queries for generating actionable business insights.

🎯 Who Should Use This?
This repository is ideal for:

SQL Developers

Data Engineers

ETL Developers

Data Analysts

Aspiring Data Architects

Whether you're a student or professional, this project helps you build and demonstrate key skills in data handling and analytics.

🛠️ Tools & Resources
Best part? Everything is free!

Datasets: Includes ERP and CRM data in CSV format.

SQL Server Express: Lightweight SQL database for hosting the warehouse.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): GUI to manage SQL databases.

Git & GitHub: Version control and collaboration tools.

Draw.io: Used for designing data architecture, flow, and models.
